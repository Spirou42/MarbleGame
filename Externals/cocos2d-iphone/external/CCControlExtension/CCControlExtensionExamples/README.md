CCControlButton provides a convenient way to create buttons with Cocos2D.
A button intercepts touch events and sends an action message to a target object when tapped. Methods for setting the target and action are inherited from CCControl. You can set it to a predetermined size, to a variable size to fit to the title size etc. (More information on [my blog](http://yannickloriot.com/2013/03/cccontrolextension-the-buttons/))

 * [CCControlSlider](http://yannickloriot.com/library/ios/cccontrolextension/Classes/CCControlSlider.html):

CCControlSlider is an already made slider (but customizable) control for Cocos2D for iPhone. It is a visual control used to select a single value from a continuous range of values in a linear way. (More information on [my blog](http://yannickloriot.com/2013/03/cccontrolextension-the-sliders/))

The CCControlSwitch is an implementation of the UISwitch for Cocos2D for iPhone.
It is useful to create and manage On/Off buttons, like for example, in the option menus for volume as example. As with CCControlSlider, when the user manipulates the switch control ("flips" it) an UIControlEventValueChanged event is generated.
You can customize the appearance of the switch by changing the on/off background sprites and label.

* [CCControlStepper](http://yannickloriot.com/library/ios/cccontrolextension/Classes/CCControlStepper.html):

![CCControlStepper](http://github.com/YannickL/CCControlExtension/raw/master/screenshots/stepper.png)

The CCControlStepper class provides a user interface for incrementing or decrementing a value. It displays two buttons, one with a minus ("-") symbol and one with a plus ("+") symbol.

 * [CCControlPotentiometer](http://github.com/YannickL/CCControlExtension/raw/master/screenshots/potentiometer.png)
